**Minesweeper - ISC Edition** is a new take on the classic game : *Minesweeper*. Minesweeper is a single-player logic-based computer game played on a rectangular board. The goal is to locate a predetermined number of randomly-placed mines by clicking on safe squares while avoiding the squares with mines. The player must use their wits and deduction to find the squares with mines and signal them using flags. **Minesweeper - ISC Edition** takes it's visual inspiration from the ISC branch (~~which is by far the best one~~) of the HEI of Sion.

## How to play

Once you have selected one of the three difficulty available, the game will generate a board with hidden squares. Your goal is to find and flag all the hidden mines without clicking on one. **`Left-click`** on a square reveals either a number or a blank space. Numbers tell you how many mines are in the eight squares surrounding the one you just clicked. To mark a mine, **`Right-click`** to place a flag. Use the numbers to figure out where the mines are and clear all the safe squares. If you clear every safe square and flag all the mines correctly, you win! Avoid guessing and use logic to solve the puzzle.

If you find yourself stuck or wishing to change the current setting, you can press **`R`** on your keyboard to generate a new game! Pressing **`M`** will return you to the menu, while pressing **`Escape`** will close the game.
